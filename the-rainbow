Title is Rainbow and Unicorn and Pony
Red
Black
Green
Unicorn
Blue

Let's add a
verse about 
days of the
week . . .
Monday
Tuesday
Wednesday


Indigo
Orange

Purple
White
I'm not sure white is right
But Unicorn belongs here
And so does Pony

What if this were version A
of the last stanza, which I
am going to replace later
with version B?
